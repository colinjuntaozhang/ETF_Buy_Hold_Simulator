1. rebalance mechanism has some significant flaws  
  1.1 like: we calculate portfolio on 2005-09-01, get $X amount. then rebalance on the next day 2005-09-02 end price, which means we lost 1 day growth/loss. these is a gap, the gap is 1 day  
  1.2 so, the solutuion is rebalance the ETFs using the same day price as we calculate the portfolio value 
  
2. affecting parameters:  
  2.1 rebalance strategy. eg: top 3 performing sector ETFs   
  2.2 rebalance frequency eg: every 3 months  
  2.3 SPY distribution for conservativeness  eg: 60% in SPY, and stick with this ratio   
  2.4 Alpha ETF distribution  eg: evenly distributed among top 3 ETFs
